**Cluster number determination:**
it is important to predetermine the number of cluster for the clustering alogrithm to work. These alogrithms include:
k-means, l-medoids and hierarchical clustering.
Due data structure complexity, determination of optimal number of clusters may not be easy simply by observing the structure of the data. As such, there are a number of methods that can be utilized to determine optimal number of clusters. Such types of methods are:
Elbo Method
- Average Silhouette Method
- Gap Statistic Method
- calinski - Harabasz Method
- Davies - Bouldin Method
**NB:** the code for these methods can be found in link provided above.
